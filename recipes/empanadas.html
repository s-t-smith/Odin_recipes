    <em>This receipe does not include ingredients or steps for empanada pastry shells. Store-bought will suffice.</em>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g ground beef <i>(80% lean, 20% fat)</i></li>
        <li>Olive oil <i>(enough to cover the bottom of a pan)</i></li>
        <li>Garlic <i>(about four cloves)</i></li>
        <li>1 white onion, diced</li>
        <li>Chicken stock <i>(about a cup)</i></li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Equipment:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Knife and a cutting board</li>
        <li>Deep pan or pot and a good stirring spoon</li>
        <li>Baking sheet and parchment paper</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to the deep pan or pot and place over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef to hot oil. Optionally, add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir beef and cook until a layer of au ju is present in the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add diced onion, bell pepper, crushed or minced garlic.</li>
        <li>Stir the beef and vegetable mixture occasionally, cooking until the onion pieces are slightly clear.</li>
        <li>Add dry seasonings to the mixture <i>(to taste)</i> and reduce heat.</li>
        <li>If needed, add chicken stock to the pan to deglaze and increase moisture.</li>
        <li>Cook over low heat until reduced. <i>If the mixture is too wet, it will be difficult to keep in the pastry later.</i></li>
        <li>Remove mixture from heat and allow it to chill. Preheat an oven to 375F.</li>
        <li>When mixture is cool to the touch, add an amount to empanada shells, fold the shell closed and crimp the edges.<i>A fork is useful for crimping, but this can also be done by hand.</i></li>
        <li>Place filled and crimped shells onto a baking sheet covered with parchemnt paper and set the sheet in the oven at 375F for 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the empanadas from the oven and use a fork to punch a few holes in the tops <i>(this will help the mixture inside cool before serving)</i>.</li>
        <li>Serve as finger food, or with utensils and sauce!</li>
    </ol>
