        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the dry spices (garam masala, curry powder, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, ginger, salt) in a bowl and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Boil a few cups of water in a medium soup pot.</li>
            <li>Place the cashews in a bowl and cover them with the boiling water. Allow them to soak while you prep the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Peel the carrots and chop them into slices about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks about 1 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Put the carrots and potatoes in the medium pot, cover them with water and bring them to a boil. Boil the vegetables until the potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork <i>(about 15 minutes)</i>.</li>
            <li>Once th potatoes are finished, drain the vegetables and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Chop the ends off the green beans and cut them into pieces about an inch long.</li>
            <li>Drain the canned tomatoes and pour them into the blender.</li>
            <li>Peel and quarter theh onion, add it to the blender with the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Crush and peel the garlic cloves, then add them to the blender.</li>
            <li>Blend the tomatoes and onion until a smooth puree is made.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil to the large pot and place the pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato puree to the large pot and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the dry spice mix to the puree and stir for 2 to 3 minutes, allowing the spices to "bloom" in the mix.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat under the large pot to bring the puree to a simmer <i>(letting the puree simmer low for a while usually helps bring out the flavors, so no need to rush)</i>.</li>
            <li>Drain the cashews and add them to the blender.</li>
            <li>Pour the coconut milk in the blender with cashews and blend them into a fine mix.</li>
            <li>Pour the cashew mix into the large pot with the puree.</li>
            <li>Add the peas and green beans to the large pot and cook until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and potatoes, stirring regularly and letting everything simmer up to the same temperature.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve over basmati rice or naan.</li>
